# 🍽️ Restaurant Order Analysis in SQL

This SQL project focuses on analyzing menu and order data from a restaurant's relational database. Using basic to advanced SQL queries, I explored key business metrics such as most popular dishes, top spending customers, item category trends, and order patterns over time.

## 📊 Project Objectives

### 🔹 Objective 1: Menu Insights
- Viewed the entire `menu_items` table.
- Counted total items on the menu.
- Identified the latest and most expensive items.
- Analyzed the number and pricing of Italian dishes.
- Grouped menu items by category to count and average price.

### 🔹 Objective 2: Order Trends
- Explored the `order_details` table.
- Extracted the date range of customer orders.
- Calculated total and unique orders.
- Found the order with the most items.
- Identified orders with more than 12 items.

### 🔹 Objective 3: Combined Analysis
- Joined `menu_items` and `order_details` to create a unified dataset.
- Found least and most frequently ordered items.
- Analyzed top 5 highest spending orders.
- Explored categories in top-spend orders to derive item preferences.
